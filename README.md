Grand Viz Auto
==============

_A month of glamorous data visualization and mapping, using the first-ever* Massachusetts-wide vehicle-miles traveled dataset._

* as far as we are aware



For the moment
------------------------------

It's just a static page.


Soon
------------------------------

There will be an API that serves out vehicle-miles traveled data and more.


Getting Set Up for Development
------------------------------

We will include a Vagrantfile which you can use on any operating system to automatically install all of the dependencies. That way, you can be up and running (and forking) within minutes.



1. Download [Vagrant][dl].
2. Work through the [Getting Started][gs] guide until you can set up an empty precise32 box.
