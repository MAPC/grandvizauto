        <strong>Visualizations, analysis, maps, animations, infographics, interactive web tools, games</strong>, and any other data-driven medium that reveals patterns and helps inform action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Answers to driving questions</strong> related to transportation, energy, land use, and policy, such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What makes a neighborhood more likely to have high car ownership and mileage?
            </li>
            <li>
              How much are households spending on gas? Where does driving place the biggest burden on family budgets?
            </li>
            <li>
              Where might investments in walking, biking and transit have the biggest impact in reducing how much people drive?
            </li>
            <li>
              What is the best way for communities to measure greenhouse gas emissions and set goals for reducing them?
