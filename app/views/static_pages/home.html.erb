      <aside>
        A six-week challenge to find and present the patterns in 37 billion miles of data
      </aside>

      <p>
        The Metropolitan Area Planning Council invites you to visualize, analyze, and otherwise hack a dataset of vehicle ownership and mileage for every car in Massachusetts, the first dataset of its kind in the country.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What We're Looking For
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Visualizations, animations, maps, infographics, games, and any other data-driven medium that reveals patterns and uncovers insights hidden in this vast dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
          Answers driving questions related to transportation, energy, land use, and policy, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              What makes a neighborhood more likely to have high car ownership and mileage?
            </li>
            <li>
              Where might investments in walking, biking and transit have the biggest impact in reducing how much people drive?
            </li>
            <li>
              How much gas does the average household buy, and how is this changing over time?
            </li>
            <li>
              Where does the cost of driving place the biggest burden on family budgets?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do minimum parking requirements for new development match up with vehicle ownership rates in different communities?
            </li>
            <li>
              What is the best way for communities to measure GHG emissions and set goals for reducing them?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
