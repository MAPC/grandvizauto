        The Challenge
      </h1>
      <aside>
        A five-week contest to figure out why Massachusetts cars and trucks are driving 37 billion miles each year 
      </aside>

      <p>
        The Metropolitan Area Planning Council, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative invite you to to delve into a new trove of anonymous vehicle-use data and discover insights that can help the Commonwealth build a more efficient and sustainable transportation system.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What We're Looking For
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Visualizations, analysis, maps, animations, infographics, interactive web tools, games</strong>, and any other data-driven medium that reveals patterns and helps inform action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Answers to driving questions</strong> related to transportation, energy, land use, and policy, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              What predicts auto usage, and where are the opportunities to reduce it? Vehicle ownership rates and mileage per vehicle vary substantially within and across the state’s communities. What neighborhood, community, or regional characteristics help to explain this variation? Do the results suggest certain areas or actions that might represent the best opportunities for shifting car travel to more sustainable modes of transportation?
            </li>
            <li>
              What are people driving, and how much does it cost? Transportation costs make up a significant share of household expenses, especially for low income families. How much are households spending to own a vehicle and fill up its tank? How do these costs vary across the state? Which communities bear the biggest burden when it comes to the cost of driving? Can this information be presented in a format that helps people make more informed choices about where to live?  
            </li>
            <li>
             Will there ever be enough parking? Concerns about parking permeate every community, yet there is little basis to determine how much is needed. Do municipal parking requirements for new development reflect vehicle ownership rates in different communities? How much land will be dedicated to parking if ownership rates and regulatory requirements hold steady as the region grows? 
            </li>
            <li>
             What can communities do about it? Cities and towns across the state are making efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint, with more sustainable transportation a key strategy. What statistics can help communities to benchmark greenhouse gas emissions and set targets for improvement? Can information about fleet mix and usage patterns help guide local efforts to encourage more sustainable transportation choices?  How can local statistics be presented in interactive formats that support learning and outreach?  
            <li>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        The Data

      <aside>
        A one-of-a-kind resource for Massachusetts
      </aside>

      <p>
        The Massachusetts Vehicle Census contains anonymized information about the age, model, estimated mileage, fuel efficiency, and zip code of passenger and commercial vehicles registered in the state from 2008 to 2011. There is also a spatial dataset of 250 meter grid cells with statistics on vehicles per household, mileage per vehicle, and greenhouse gas emissions. A companion package includes a wide range of spatial data, including population, businesses, property statistics, and the built environment, for each grid cell. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council created the Vehicle Census of Massachusetts, on which the Challenge is based, in partnership with MassDOT and with support from the Barr Foundation.
